"Research indicates that almost 60% of a programmer's time is spent understanding code rather than writing code." - Felienne Hermans (author of 'The Programmer's Brain')

... yet when we teach and learn programming, we predominantly focus on 'how to write code' and hardly ever 'how to read code'.

In programming there is an accepted paradigm of learn by copying and do by writing. We might be better off if we spent more time thinking and comprehending. Another side-effect of this copy paste / write first culture is that we often replace each other's code rather than trying to read and understand how and why the code we are working on might have been written that way.

Katja has been running code reading clubs for a couple of years, based on activities designed in collaboration with researcher and CompSci professor Felienne Hermans.

In this session, she'll share some techniques and examples that could help you run this club in your workplace or practice on your own. You might be surprised what you learn by hearing how your colleagues read code and talking about each other's perspectives together.
