<h3>Bio</h3>
A countryside childhood led Rebecca to study Biology at the University of Exeter, with high hopes of learning how to save the planet. Science turned out to mainly mean jumping through academic hoops in a lab coat, so she volunteered at science festivals, studied business modules, edited a newspaper, and interned in marketing agencies - all of which confirmed a new aim of freelance comms (fittingly, her final project won the cohort award for Best Communication). Rebecca received disabled student support while studying and remains passionate about increasing accessibility regardless of health conditions.

Saving the planet remains a priority for Rebecca, but she now pursues this by elevating the work of her ethical clients and by supporting NGOs.

Rebecca was included in Exeter’s 100 Most Influential Women, and the only way she can share such information without cringing is by writing in the third person.

Rebecca is the youngest Trustee Director to sit on the board of a Wildlife Trust (Devon), and spends about half a day a week living out her saving the planet dreams on a regional level. She Chairs DWT’s Nomination and Development Committee, through which she champions diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism.

She goes by Bex, never Becky, and - being from the North - will have extra gravy, please.
