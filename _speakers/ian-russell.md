DataOps is by no means a new methodology but selecting the right tools and skillsets to make DataOps effective is crucial.

In this session we will look at what is DataOps, what considerations need to be made before embarking on the project and how Azure and the wider Microsoft ecosystem can be used to release the benefits and opportunities DataOps can provide.

Rapid innovation, increased collaboration, improved transparency and reduced error rates are just some of the outcomes of a successful DataOps project which will ultimately provide improved experiences for both customers and staff.
