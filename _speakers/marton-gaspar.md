If innovation is more and better ideas then having people in the room who's brain are structured differently will help the business get different ideas. Al diversity is good but Neurodiversity (Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia) is very underrepresented currently. 

I'm aiming to raise awareness of the superpowers of these ND people and how companies could benefit from it. I'm proposing to do this by going through the funnel of recruitment to culture and belonging. From job ads to removing biases in the interviewing process, through how to manage and help ND individuals to belong to your companies culture.
