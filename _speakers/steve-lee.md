The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides widely applicable standards with guidance on ensuring <strong>accessibility of electronic content</strong> and software, For example, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is well known as a technical standard that also applies beyond the web and is referenced in policies. WAI has developed its website to be a comprehensive resource providing clear introductions and materials supporting the use of accessibility standards including WCAG. This session will provide an introduction and overview of the WAI website. 

There is a growing awareness of the accessibility requirements of people with <strong>cognitive and learning disabilities</strong>. A new resource from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Accessibility Guidelines Working Group provides practical guidance on improving cognitive accessibility.
