# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO

In this talk I would like to look at the concept of how innovation is fuelled by the ability and access to explore different ways of thinking and doing.

It has been said that entrepreneurship is to "take action to create something new of value to others through the process of trial and error".

Delving in to this further exposes the need to seek and put in place access to resources that can enable that trial and error.

This can look like physical resources, such as new software and hardware. But this can also look like access to people, in the form of peers, leaders, academia and so on. 

Finally, I'd like to shine a light on the art of looking sideways and how exploring unrelated technology, communities and methodology can bring new ways of thinking to your own.

<h3>Bio</h3>

Having started life as a graphic and web designer/developer, I have moved in around the support landscape for 15 years. 

I have specialised in helping startups and small organisations to make technology decisions that can scale as they grow.

This has led to my current role as SETsquared  Technology Manager, running a structured programme of technology evaluation and incubation support.
