# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

English is the world's most widely used language yet only one in seven people speak it. If your website or app can be used by non-English speakers in emerging markets, your profits will rise exponentially!

Internationalization seems easy until you try it. Languages and dialects vary. Translated words can be significantly longer than English. Text isn't always oriented from left to right.

In this talk, Craig explains a technology which can make multi-locale development a little easier. The JavaScript Internationalization API won't solve all your translation woes, but it will help avoid confusion and misunderstandings when showing dates, times, numbers, currencies, lists, and plurals.
