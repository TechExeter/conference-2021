# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO

People want to be around those who inspire, motivate them, and who are well liked/highly regarded at work. They want to work in a team with these motivating and inspiring people. Soft skills are underrated but it is more important especially as we are working online. Some people may lack soft skills as they lack confidence and they may become defensive which is not conducive to a great work environment. Being defensive occurs both in junior and in senior roles and should be immediately addressed and rectified when identified.
 
In this presentation I’ll address some of the ways to build confidence, improve your soft skills (even though we are all working remotely), how to develop relationships with people at work who want you in their team (and who want to implement recommendations you suggest), how this will positively affect your work and how you will then grow your confidence and what you can achieve both professionally and personally.
