Most apps and websites unnecessarily exclude millions of people.
An inclusive user interface does not really take longer to design or build – if you know how to do it.

The problem is lack of knowledge, not lack of time or money.
And there are many misconceptions about accessibility.

This session will help you think more clearly and concretely about accessibility.
It’ll help you bake accessibility into your own practice and your team.
