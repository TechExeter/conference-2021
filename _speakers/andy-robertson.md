# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

Video games are an important part of childhood. We have seen how they have kept children connected with each other and provided space to escape the world. They are also a playground where physical ability isn't the defining factor of who can play or who wins.

Finding the right games for your child can be hard, but the Family Video Game Database (<a href="https://www.taminggaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.taminggaming.com/</a>) provides a way to search for a perfect match. This includes over 100 fields to help you find family games for those with a disability. 

In this talk, Andy explains the breadth of video game accessibility and walks you through the search tools available to find the games with features to enable your family to play games together.
