<p>Whether you're a startup, scale-up, or enterprise business, you need to be intentional about your inclusivity. You’re awesome, why not share that awesomeness with as many people as possible.</p> 

Did you know that you’re alienating potentially amazing customers through your tone of voice, your imagery, and your branding? 

It’s incredibly important to be your authentic badass self with your brand, but you also need to consider who you’re talking to and how people will respond to it.

For example, if your website doesn’t meet accessibility standards, you’re telling people they don’t even deserve to use it. 

Sometimes it’s hard to tell if what you’re doing isn’t being received well, especially if you’re not part of a diverse team. So we need to work harder, to make sure we’re more accessible and inclusive. 

In this talk, we’ll explore ways that you might be alienating people with your marketing - as some of them can be quite surprising. 
I’ll share some top tips on how to improve your inclusivity, and you’ll leave with some cool actionable things you can do to level up your messaging.
